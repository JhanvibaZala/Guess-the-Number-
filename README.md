# Guess-the-Number-
The Guess the Number game challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range (e.g., 1-100). The game provides hints like "Too High" or "Too Low" after each guess. The user has a limited number of attempts, and the game displays previous guesses and remaining chances.
